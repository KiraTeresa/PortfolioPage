                    <p>I am a Web Developer with a background in business, marketing and e-commerce.</p>

                    <p>Having been working as a project manager in business and marketing, I developed a great structured working method and organizational skills. Both having played a major role on my way of becoming a web developer.</p>

                    <p>As a product content and brand manager for an e-commerce, using product management and content management systems is part of my everyday job. It is interesting to see the connection between those tools and finally visualize the content in our browser. Working with those programs aroused my interest for the logic behind and sparked my motivation to start looking into coding.</p>

                    <p>I ended up applying for the Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack and started the remote part-time program in May 2022. In the following 6 month I was able to acquire a complete skill set which qualifies myself to work as a Web Developer. With every skill learned, new knowledge gained and tech challenge accomplished, my intention to work in this field strengthened even more.</p>

                    <p>Do I know everything? Surely I don't. But that is also great about having chosen this path. There is a lot to learn. I will struggle, get challenged and succeed, but most of all, I will always keep growing.</p>
